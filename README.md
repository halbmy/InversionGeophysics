**Inverse Problems in Geophysics** 

given at TU Bergakademie Freiberg in Winter term 2024/2025. 
It aims at understanding inverse problems and learning how to solve them, covering
- differentiating problem types
- the least-squares method
- the minimum-norm solution
- singular value decomposition (SVD) and the truncated SVD inverse
- regularization methods like smoothness constraints
- resolution analysis
- non-linear problems using gradient and Gauss-Newton methods
- introduction to probabilistic methods and global minimization
using
- straight-ray (and curved-ray) traveltime tomography in 2D
- nonlinear Direct Current and Magnetotelluric inversion in 1D
